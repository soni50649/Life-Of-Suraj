    <h1>Life</h1>
    <p>In this page, we should be looking at how my life is going on and stuff like that.</p>

    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <p>Life is good. The bootcamp is going fairly well and I have tried top trumps and realised that my head is not comprehending the information properly which brings me to here talking about how my life is because hopefully yours is good and by the time I present it, it looks way better than what I am dealing with currently cos it ain't cutting it outside of here for now.</p>
