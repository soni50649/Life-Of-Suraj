    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
    <p>Here, we talk about where have I worked and for how long.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Description of the Situation</h2>
    <p>I don't have the most work experience when compared to the other people who are here younger or older cos I only have had 2 jobs before this and they are both kind of meh:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sainsbury's: worked there for a week and got sacked without having been told what was so bad about me</li>
        <li>Kickstarter Role at Chipkoo Labs: "Done it" for the 6 months cos I was commanded by my work coach to accept the opportunity so I folded.</li>
    </ol>
