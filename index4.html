    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>In here, I should be talking about stuff I have done to keep me sane and stuff.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As I have mentioned before in the about section, I like to play football if an opportunity arises because I will be honest here, I am the last pick of the team. That doesn't mean that I provide nothing but I do like to defend and I have explored the option of being that N'golo Kante type of midfielder who causes problems purely for the sake of it but then I am a mess physically which makes the press not survive for very long so anyone who got a space left in the team, please holla at me cos I can do with some fitness work and work on the tekkers so I am not the last pick anymore. </p>

    <h2>Other things I have attempted and dabbled into:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Working out</li>
        <li>Runnig by itself</li>
        <li>Attempting at learning a new language (Nederlands)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Other Things I also encourage myself to do</h2>
    <p>Mainly try to explore new areas cos after all, there's not a lot of people who have said that they have visited the UK and for a lot of them it is not a possible journey so I try to do new things like playing minigolf or a TopGolf like scenario as well as actually visiting central london and try to maybe go on the London Eye or the aquarium or sky garden or just visit Hyde Park or go to oxford street. There really is a nice selection things to do in London so if I ever move out of here I will not feel good about it.</p>
